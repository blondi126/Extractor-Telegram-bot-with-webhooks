# Archive to mega.nz

**Telegram bot** created for personal and close friends use. It is not used so often, therefore, in order not to load the server, it is implemented with webhooks.

When meeting, the bot asks for data from the mega.nz account and saves them. If necessary, they can be changed with the ```/switch``` command.

Next, the bot waits for the archive. Currently works with ```.zip``` and ```.rar``` extensions. More will be added in the future. 

Extracts media files of certain formats. Can be added if needed.
